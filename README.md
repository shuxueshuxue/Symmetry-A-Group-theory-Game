# Symmetry

Symmetry is an interactive game about group theory. In group theory, each finite group has a finite multiplication table that exhibits certain patterns and follows specific rules. By filling in missing information on the multiplication table, players can gain a deeper understanding of these rules.

This repository includes a group class that allows for basic manipulation of groups with orders up to 20. Additionally, a group identification function is provided to identify a group based on its multiplication table.

The game is accompanied by a simple user interface implemented in Pygame.

How to play
To play the game, simply run the program and follow the on-screen instructions. Players will be presented with a partially filled multiplication table and must fill in the remaining cells based on the given information.
